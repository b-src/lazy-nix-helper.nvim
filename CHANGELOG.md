# Changelog

## UNRELEASED

### Docs

- Update sanitizePluginName function in example NixOS config in README to account for plugins that have moved to different package sets since the original release of lazy-nix-helper
- Add nixCats and nvf to the Alternatives section in the README

## [0.6.0] 2024-08-28

### Features

- Setting `friendly_plugin_names` will cause the plugin to normalize discovered plugin names even when they are coming from the an input plugin table generated by nixos. This enables additional case-insensitivity and hyphen/underscore insensitivity and makes `friendly_plugin_names` behave more like a user would anticipate. It's still recommended to set this to off

### Meta

- Use the actual plugin discovery function in core test setup instead of setting the plugin table directly

## [0.5.0] 2024-08-28

### Features

- Update `get_plugin_path()` to check for a `-scm` suffix when `friendly_plugin_names` is set

### Fixes

- Set `friendly_plugin_names` to `false` by default
- Fix an issue when `friendly_plugin_names` is enabled where an exact match of the plugin name would not be found if the plugin name was altered by the normalize function

### Docs

- Add missing `lib` input in recommended nix configuration
- Remove note about plugin names in lazy dashboard since this was fixed upstream at some point

## [0.4.0] 2023-12-29

### Features

- Support passing a nix-generated table of plugin names:plugin paths instead of plugin discovery within the plugin
  + This should also mean that Lazy-Nix-Helper will work with nix-installed plugins on a non-NixOS system, but I haven't tested that

### Docs

- Update docs to provide instructions for generating the input plugin table from Nix
